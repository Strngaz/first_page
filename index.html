            <p>Programming refers to a technological process for telling a computer which tasks to perform in order to solve problems. You can think of programming as a collaboration between humans and computers, in which humans create instructions for a computer to follow (code) in a language computers can understand.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Just as recipes have their own syntax, so the programs have their own syntax. Every program is written in some programming language that has its own syntax. Every program is translated into machine code which machine (computer, tablet, phone) executes.</p>
            <div class="slika">
                <img src="./images/programming_pic.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>The program expects input data and instructions for working with data. A program always has some form of data for processing. Data can be hardcoded or data which depend on external factors (input user, bar code reading, scanning documents etc.)</p>

            </div>
            <p>Program development is simply called programming. Program development implies use special tools - programming languages.</p>

            <p>I started a few months ago. I decided to make this webpage so i can share my toughts with you in hope it will make you easier to decide either you want to learn programming or not. And i just finished learning HTML so i wanted to try it out <i class="fa-regular fa-face-smile"></i></p>
            <p>So as you can see I am still newbie at programming but my goal is to encourage you to start and try to help you to learn.</p>
            <p>And without further delay i will talk about programming stuff and much more on&nbsp;<a href="https://strnga.siterubix.com/" target="_blank">STRNGA</a>.&nbsp;Here you can come and we will talk about programming, someone with more expirience will help us maybe (i could really use some help), and i will try to make it fun as much as possible <i class="fa-regular fa-face-smile"></i></p>
